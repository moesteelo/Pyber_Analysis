## Summary 

-	Based on the results here are three recommendations to the CEO:
1. Opportunities to expand the ride sharing platform by hiring more drivers in rural and suburban cities, thus lowering the average fare per ride for costumers.
2. In Urban cities – opportunities to expand more rides for drivers and customers are happy. 
3. In Rural Cities – opportunities to expand Total Fares by marketing and advertising by offering exclusive deals for new customers and frequent loyal customer discount.
